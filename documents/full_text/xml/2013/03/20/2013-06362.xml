          <P>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (Office) is correcting final regulations that were published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on January 18, 2013 (78 FR 4212) (“Fee Setting final rule”) to set and adjust patent fees as authorized by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (“AIA”). The Fee Setting rule became effective on March 19, 2013 (except that certain regulations relating to international applications become effective on January 1, 2014). This rulemaking corrects those final regulations to revise minor inconsistencies within the Fee Setting final rule or arising from other recent rulemakings under the AIA. It also corrects minor inconsistencies with a few of the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and typographical errors.</P>

        <P>On January 18, 2013, the Office published the Fee Setting final rule setting and adjusting patent fees as authorized by the AIA. <E T="03">See Setting and Adjusting Patent Fees,</E> 78 FR 4212 (Jan. 18, 2013) (“Fee Setting final rule”). This interim rule is a procedural correction to minor inconsistencies within the Fee Setting final rule or arising from other recent rulemakings under the AIA, namely: Changes to Implement the First Inventor to File Provisions of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 78 FR 11024 (Feb. 14, 2013) (“FITF final rule”); Changes to Implement Micro Entity Status for Paying Patent Fees, 77 FR 75019 (Dec. 19, 2012) (“Micro Entity final rule”); Changes to Implement the Inventor's Oath or Declaration Provisions of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 77 FR 48776 (Aug. 14, 2012) (“Inventor's Oath or Declaration final rule”); and Changes to Implement the Preissuance Submissions by Third Parties Provision of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 77 FR 42150 (July 17, 2012) (“Third Party Submissions final rule”). It also corrects minor inconsistencies with the nomenclature and application of a few of the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, as well as typographical errors. Good cause exists to make these minor corrections without prior notice and opportunity for comment and to be effective shortly after the effective date of the Fee Setting final rule to avoid inconsistent provisions. For ease of reference, this interim rule provides the full text of the corrected rules. These rules are 37 CFR 1.17, 1.20, 1.445, 1.482, 41.37 and 41.45.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Brief Description of Corrections</HD>

        <P>This interim rule corrects minor inconsistencies and typographical errors in the text of 37 CFR 1.17, 1.20, 1.445, 1.482, 41.37 and 41.45 (which were published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on January 18, 2013 (78 FR 4212)), as described briefly below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Section 1.17</HD>

        <P>In paragraph (b), revise “For fees in proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, <E T="03">see</E> § 41.20 of this title” to “For fees in proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, <E T="03">see</E> § 41.20 and § 42.15 of this title” to correct a typographical error in the Fee Setting final rule. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 4285.</P>

        <P>In paragraph (g), add “§ 1.46—for filing an application on behalf of an inventor by a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter” and “§ 1.55(f)—for filing a belated certified copy of a foreign application.” These corrections are made because the FITF final rule established these fees under this paragraph. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 11052.</P>

        <P>In paragraph (g), delete “§ 1.47—for filing by other than all the inventors or a person not the inventor.” This correction is made because the Inventor's Oath or Declaration final rule removed this fee. <E T="03">See</E> 77 FR 48816.</P>

        <P>In paragraph (g), delete “§ 1.295—for review of refusal to publish a statutory invention registration” and “§ 1.296—to withdraw a request for publication of a statutory invention registration filed on or after the date the notice of intent to publish issued.” These corrections are made because the FITF final rule removed these fees. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 11059.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (i)(1), add “§ 1.29(k)(3)—for processing a non-itemized fee deficiency based on an error in micro entity status.” This correction is made because the Micro-<PRTPAGE P="17103"/>Entity final rule established this fee under this paragraph. <E T="03">See</E> 77 FR 75035.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (i)(1), revise “§ 1.41—for supplying the name or names of the inventor or inventors after the filing date without an oath or declaration as prescribed by § 1.63, except in provisional applications” to “§ 1.41(b)—for supplying the name or names of the inventor or joint inventors in an application without either an application data sheet or the inventor's oath or declaration, except in provisional applications.” This correction is made because the Inventor's Oath or Declaration final rule established this fee under this subparagraph. <E T="03">See</E> 77 FR 48814.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (i)(1), revise “§ 1.53(b)(3)” to “§ 1.53(c)(3)” to correct a typographical error in the Fee Setting final rule. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 4286.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (i)(1), revise “§ 1.55—for entry of late priority papers” to “§ 1.55—for entry of a priority claim or certified copy of a foreign application after payment of the issue fee.” This correction is made because the FITF final rule established this fee under this paragraph. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 11052.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (i)(1), delete “§ 1.99(e)—for processing a belated submission under § 1.99.” This correction is made because the Third Party Submissions final rule removed this fee. <E T="03">See</E> 77 FR 42173.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (i)(1), delete “§ 1.497(d)—for filing an oath or declaration pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 371(c)(4) naming an inventive entity different from the inventive entity set forth in the international stage.” This correction is made because the Inventor's Oath or Declaration final rule removed this fee. <E T="03">See</E> 77 FR 48824-25.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (i)(2), delete “By other than a small or micro entity.” This correction addresses a typographical error in the Fee Setting final rule. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 4267, Table 43.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Section 1.20</HD>

        <P>In paragraph (d), delete “By other than a small or micro entity.” This correction addresses a typographical error in the Fee Setting final rule. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 4223.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Section 1.445</HD>
        <P>In subparagraph (a)(1)(i)(A), revise “For a transmittal fee paid on or after January 1, 2014” to “For an international application having a receipt date that is on or after January 1, 2014.” In subparagraph (a)(1)(i)(B), revise “For a transmittal fee paid before January 1, 2014” to “For an international application having a receipt date that is before January 1, 2014.”</P>

        <P>The foregoing corrections ensure consistent nomenclature with and application of Rules 14-16 under the regulations adopted under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.</P>

        <P>In subparagraph (a)(4), delete 1.445(a)(4)(i) and 1.445(a)(4)(ii). This corrects an inconsistency within 37 CFR § 1.445(a)(4) in the Fee Setting final rule. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 4289.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Section 1.482</HD>

        <P>In subparagraph (a)(2)(i), revise “For an additional preliminary examination fee filed on or after January 1, 2014” to “If the international preliminary examination fee set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section was paid on or after January 1, 2014.” In subparagraph (a)(2)(ii), revise “For an additional preliminary examination fee filed before January 1, 2014” to “If the international preliminary examination fee set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section was paid before January 1, 2014.”</P>
        <P>The foregoing corrections ensure consistent nomenclature with and application of Rules 57 and 58 under the regulations adopted under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Section 41.37</HD>

        <P>In paragraph (a), second sentence, replace “§ 41.48” with “§ 41.45” to correct a typographical error in the Fee Setting final rule. <E T="03">See</E> 78 FR 4291.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rulemaking Considerations</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">A. Administrative Procedure Act:</E> This rulemaking is a procedural correction to revise minor inconsistencies within the Fee Setting final rule or arising from other recent rulemakings under the AIA, namely: The FITF final rule; the Micro Entity final rule; the Inventor's Oath or Declaration final rule; and the Third Party Submissions final rule. It also corrects minor inconsistencies with the nomenclature and application of a few of the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, as well as typographical errors. This interim rule does not set or adjust fees under the fee setting authority provided in Section 10 of the AIA. These changes do not alter the amount of fees or the obligation to pay fees, nor do they alter the substantive criteria of patentability or patent term adjustment. Therefore, these changes involve rules of agency practice and procedure, and are not subject to prior notice and an opportunity for comment. <E T="03">See</E> 5 U.S.C. 553(b); <E T="03">see also Bachow Commc'ns, Inc.</E> v.<E T="03"> F.C.C.,</E> 237 F.3d 683, 690 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (rules governing an application process are procedural under the Administrative Procedure Act).</P>
        <P>In addition, good cause exists to make these procedural changes without prior notice and opportunity for comment and to be effective immediately to avoid inconsistencies and confusion with the Fee Setting final rule.</P>
        <P>Although prior notice and opportunity for public comment are not required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) or (c) (or any other law), nor is the thirty-day delay in effectiveness under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) required, the Office nonetheless provides the opportunity for comment as it seeks the benefit of the public's views on these corrections to the Fee Setting final rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act:</E> For the reasons set forth herein, the Deputy General Counsel for General Law of the <PRTPAGE P="17104"/>United States Patent and Trademark Office has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that changes in this rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <E T="03">See</E> 5 U.S.C. 605(b).</P>
        <P>The changes in this rulemaking are procedural corrections to revise minor inconsistencies within the Fee Setting final rule or arising from other recent rulemakings under the AIA. This rulemaking also corrects minor inconsistencies with the nomenclature and application of a few of the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, as well as typographical errors. This interim rule does not set or adjust fees under the fee setting authority provided in Section 10 of the AIA. These changes do not alter the amount of fees or the obligation to pay fees, nor do they alter the substantive criteria of patentability or patent term adjustment. These changes do not add any additional requirements (including information collection requirements) or fees for patent applicants or patentees. For these reasons, the changes in this rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">C. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review):</E> This rulemaking has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 (Sept. 30, 1993).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">D. Executive Order 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review):</E> The Office has complied with Executive Order 13563. Specifically, the Office has, to the extent feasible and applicable: (1) Made a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs of the rule; (2) tailored the rule to impose the least burden on society consistent with obtaining the regulatory objectives; (3) selected a regulatory approach that maximizes net benefits; (4) specified performance objectives; (5) identified and assessed available alternatives; (6) involved the public in an open exchange of information and perspectives among experts in relevant disciplines, affected stakeholders in the private sector and the public as a whole, and provided on-line access to the rulemaking docket; (7) attempted to promote coordination, simplification, and harmonization across government agencies and identified goals designed to promote innovation; (8) considered approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of choice for the public; and (9) ensured the objectivity of scientific and technological information and processes.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">E. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism):</E> This rulemaking does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment under Executive Order 13132 (Aug. 4, 1999).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">F. Executive Order 13175 (Tribal Consultation):</E> This rulemaking will not: (1) Have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes; (2) impose substantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribal governments; or (3) preempt tribal law. Therefore, a tribal summary impact statement is not required under Executive Order 13175 (Nov. 6, 2000).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">G. Executive Order 13211 (Energy Effects):</E> This rulemaking is not a significant energy action under Executive Order 13211 because this rulemaking is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. Therefore, a Statement of Energy Effects is not required under Executive Order 13211 (May 18, 2001).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">H. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform):</E> This rulemaking meets applicable standards to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden as set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 (Feb. 5, 1996).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">I. Executive Order 13045 (Protection of Children):</E> This rulemaking does not concern an environmental risk to health or safety that may disproportionately affect children under Executive Order 13045 (Apr. 21, 1997).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">J. Executive Order 12630 (Taking of Private Property):</E> This rulemaking will not affect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630 (Mar. 15, 1988).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">K. Congressional Review Act:</E> Under the Congressional Review Act provisions of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 801 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), prior to issuing any final rule, the United States Patent and Trademark Office will submit a report containing the final rule and other required information to the United States Senate, the United States House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office.</P>
        <P>The changes in this rulemaking are not expected to result in an annual effect on the economy of 100 million dollars or more, a major increase in costs or prices, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets. Therefore, this rulemaking is not expected to result in a “major rule” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">L. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995:</E> The changes set forth in this rulemaking do not involve a Federal intergovernmental mandate that will result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, of 100 million dollars (as adjusted) or more in any one year, or a Federal private sector mandate that will result in the expenditure by the private sector of 100 million dollars (as adjusted) or more in any one year, and will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions are necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. <E T="03">See</E> 2 U.S.C. 1501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">M. National Environmental Policy Act:</E> This rulemaking will not have any effect on the quality of the environment and is thus categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. <E T="03">See</E> 42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">N. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act:</E> The requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) are not applicable because this rulemaking does not contain provisions which involve the use of technical standards.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">O. Paperwork Reduction Act:</E> The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires that the Office consider the impact of paperwork and other information collection burdens imposed on the public. The collection of information involved in the Fee Setting final rule was submitted to OMB with that final rule as a new information collection request and was preapproved under OMB control number 0651-0072. The changes in this interim rule are procedural corrections to revise minor inconsistencies within the Fee Setting final rule or arising from other recent rulemakings under the AIA. This rulemaking also corrects minor inconsistencies with the nomenclature and application of a few of the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, as well as typographical errors. This interim rule does not set or adjust fees under the fee setting authority provided in Section 10 of the AIA. These changes do not alter the amount of fees or the obligation to pay fees, nor do they alter the substantive criteria of patentability or patent term adjustment. These changes do not add any additional requirements (including information collection <PRTPAGE P="17105"/>requirements) or fees for patent applicants or patentees. Therefore, the Office is not resubmitting information collection packages to OMB for its review and approval because the changes in this rulemaking do not affect the information collection requirements associated with the information collections approved under OMB control number 0651-0072 or any other information collections.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection of information displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>
